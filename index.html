  <br> The game has six characters you will meet on the way that can become part of your team.
    You also have the option to leave them behind, though it's best to bring them on your adventure as they can be helpful.</br>
 
<font size="3"> <b>Below you will learn about each character with my description of them, what they look like, and be able to hear what 
 they sound like with audios of their greeting </b> </font>

  <br> Lae'zel is the first character that you meet in the ship, She is a Githyanki, and her class is a fighter. 
  Lea'zel is very stern and always wants to stay on track.  She doesn't 100% trust you, or really anyone. 
  She's more likely to trust you if you made your character also a Githyanki. </br>

<br> Although Scratch isn't one of the main characters you can play, you do have a chance to have him as a companion. 
 You find Scratch with his sadly deceased owner in the outdoors on your journey. He may act angry or sad towards you, but if you choose your options correctly,
Scratch will become your group's dog. He hangs out at camp, and you can interact with him by throwing his ball or petting him. 
 He is just a good boy who gives you a serotonin boost when you need it, like right after a fight or just after a long day. </br>

 <br> You can get another compainion if you make the right choices though I wont give to much away on what the companion is. </br>
 <br> Yes it is nice to have these characters around though some decisons can be made where not all join your group. </br>

   <br> Another favorite of mine is the character deisgn. There is tons on tons of ways to make your character. </br>
   <br> You pick your class, and race along with how you look, from hair to tattoos, accesories and many more things </br>
   <br> Here is a video from _____ on them making there charcter </br>
   (Link code and credit here)
   
   <br> Here is the character I made for my recent run through og the game. </br>
   (photo of him here)

   <br> Character making doesn't just stop there; throughout the game, you can buy, be gifted, take, or find more clothing as you play, which adds more customization. Also, at the camp,
   you can use the mirror to edit your features too, especially if you want to show character growth/changes as the game goes on. </br>

   <br> Those are only a few of my favorite things about the game. It gives you a lot to work with to make every player's experience different. </br>
