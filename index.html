  <br> The game has six characters you will meet on the way that can become part of your team.</br>
  <br> You also have the option to leave them behind, though it's best to bring them on your adventure as they can be helpful.</br>

  <br> Laezel is the first character that you meet in the ship, She is a Githyanki, and her class is a fighter. 
  Lea'zel is very sturn and always wants to stay on track.  She doesn't 100% trust you, or really anyone. 
  She's more likely to trust you if you made your character also a Githyanki.
