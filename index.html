  <!-- Section about what BG3 is -->
<body> 
  <br> Baldur's Gate 3, also known as BG3, is one of my favorite games for many reasons. From its gam layout to its storytelling, it never gets
 old. When I say "it never gets old," I mean it. I have 3 run-throughs going right now at different stages of the game. The reason it's able to do
 that is because of its millions of paths that can occur. Paths/responses don't just get formed based on what you respond with, who you talk to
 or who you decide to keep alive or not, but also many other factors. Those factors being: what race you pick, sometimes even what subrace you pick,
 what class and subclass you pick, and what you roll on the dice. That's what makes the game so fun, no matter how many times it's played.

 <br> Here is a video of the dice roll mechanism </br>

 <br> An actual summary found on the BG3 wiki fandom page says, "Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.
Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil." (Bg3, Wiki) 
</br>
 
 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> </p>
 
 <br> There are many ways to play out this senario, you can either 100% resist the mind flare parasite tadpole's motives, or embrace it and use it for good or evil.
 This is what the parasite tadpole  looks like.

  <br> After making your character and your guardian, the game starts with you waking up in a pod that opens and you climb out. 
 You find yourself on the Nautilod Ship.

 <!-- Section on characters -->

<body> 
  <br> The game has six characters you will meet on the way that can become part of your team.
    You also have the option to leave them behind, though it's best to bring them on your adventure as they can be helpful. </br>
 
 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> </p>
 
<font size="3"> <b>Below you will learn about each character with my description of them, what they look like, and be able to hear what 
 they sound like with audios of their greeting </b> </font> 
 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> </p>

  <br> Lae'zel is the first character that you meet on the ship. She is a Githyanki, and her class is a fighter. 
  Lea'zel is very stern and always wants to stay on track.  She doesn't 100% trust you, or really anyone. 
  She's more likely to trust you if you made your character also a Githyanki. </br>

<br> Shadowheart is the second possible member you come across. We find her in one of the pods in the Nautilod. You can choose to leave her,
 or save her. If you save her, she becomes a member of your team. Shadowheart isa  half-elf and her class is a Cleric. She is stern but not as much 
 as Leaz'el is. She is more serious and a bit suspisous with the weird item of hers.</br>

 <!-- Scratch -->

<body>
     <b>Scratch</b>
 <img src="Scratch.png" width="400" height="300" alt="scratch">

    
<br> Although Scratch isn't one of the main characters you can play, you do have a chance to have him as a companion. 
 You find Scratch with his sadly deceased owner in the outdoors on your journey. He may act angry or sad towards you, but if you choose your options correctly,
Scratch will become your group's dog. He hangs out at camp, and you can interact with him by throwing his ball or petting him. 
 He is just a good boy who gives you a serotonin boost when you need it, like right after a fight or just after a long day. </br>

 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> </p>
 
 <br> You can get another compainion if you make the right choices though I wont give to much away on what the companion is. </br>
 <br> Yes it is nice to have these characters around though some decisons can be made where not all join your group. Along your journey
  you will come across many NPCS some will be enemies some will be friendly though all can be either or depending on if you decide
 to be friendly or not towards them. Sometimes you may have to act friendly to get what you want, though most of the time its either enemny or ally. </br>
 
 <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> </p>
 <br>
 Also you do have select NPC's sometimes hang out in your camp depending on their needs. I can name some of the NPCS/campaions you
  can have a chance of having visit your camp, depending on your choices. I will name four out of the many; Withers an undead character who can help you change classes and bring a team member back to life
 with a price, of course. Alfira, a Tiefling bard, we see her  at camp for the celbration of saving Halsin's party.
 There's Halsin, who can be at  your camp during and after the party if you decide to save and help him.
 Last but not least, Volo, another bard who hangs out at your camp after you save him. Again this is only four of the many NPCS you come
across and have visit your camp. </br>

   <br> Another favorite of mine is the character designing. There is tons on tons of ways to make your character. </br>
   <br> You pick your class, and race along with how you look, from hair to tattoos, accesories and many more things </br>
   <br> Here is a video from _____ on them making there charcter </br>
   (Link code and credit here)
   
   <br> Here is the character I made for my recent run through of the game. </br>
   <img src="closeup.jpg" alt="closeup"> <img src="vaelion.jpg" alt="vaelion">

   <br> Character making doesn't just stop there; throughout the game, you can buy, be gifted, take, or find more clothing as you play, which adds more customization. Also, at the camp,
   you can use the mirror to edit your features too, especially if you want to show character growth/changes as the game goes on. </br>

   <br> Those are only two of my favorite things about the game. It gives you a lot to work with to make every player's experience different. </br>
