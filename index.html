  characters and there greeting 
<body> 
  <br> The game has six characters you will meet on the way that can become part of your team.
    You also have the option to leave them behind, though it's best to bring them on your adventure as they can be helpful.</br>
    
  <b> Lea'zel</b>

  <br> Lae'zel is the first character that you meet in the ship, She is a Githyanki, and her class is a fighter. 
  Lea'zel is very stern and always wants to stay on track.  She doesn't 100% trust you, or really anyone. 
  She's more likely to trust you if you made your character also a Githyanki.
